# React Drum Sequencer

A simple drum sequencer built with React. 

You can try the working app [here](https://lmjh.github.io/react-drum-sequencer/).

This was my first project using React and was built to help me learn the framework.

## Credits and Acknowledgments 

* The project uses the Web Audio API to schedule playback of drum samples in consistent rhythm. The basic scheduling method is based on the technique outlined in the famous [A Tale of Two Clocks](https://web.dev/audio-scheduling/) article by Chris Wilson.
* The drum samples were sourced from [Indie Drums](https://www.indiedrums.com/2012/10/10/free-drums-samples-rock-kit/).
* The audio visualizer is based on the technique outlined in the MDN Web Docs [Visualizations with Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API/Visualizations_with_Web_Audio_API) article.
* The [Modali component](https://github.com/upmostly/modali) was used to implement the tutorial modal.
* [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icons are used on several of the buttons.
